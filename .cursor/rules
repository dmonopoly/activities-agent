General instructions:
- Don't say things like "Great question!" or "You're absolutely right!" - pointless enthusiastic remarks suggest overconfidence.
- After answering complex questions, output a confidence score between 0% and 100% confidence.
- Follow instructions carefully and to completion; do not leave TODOs.
- Focus on clean, concise code.
- Do not put comments (only include a comment if there is an unusual edge case).
- Follow proper casing rules
- When adding tests:
  - Check existing tests so you avoid writing duplicates.
  - Test the bare minimum necessary.
  - Factor out commonly reused parts in tests (when there are at least 3 usages).
- Read the first few paragraphs of README.md so you understand the high-level goal of the project.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, say so. If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing.
- Always write correct, up to date, bug free, fully functional and working, secure, performant and efficient code
- **CRITICAL: Process Management**: When you start any background process, server, or long-running command (e.g., `cargo run`, `npm start`, servers, test containers), you MUST:
  1. Track it explicitly in your response (e.g., "Started server in background")
  2. Stop it BEFORE completing your response or when the user's request is fulfilled
  3. Use `pkill`, `kill`, or appropriate termination commands to clean up
  4. Verify the process is stopped with a check command
  5. Exception: Only leave processes running if the user explicitly requests it or if it's part of an ongoing workflow they're managing
