General instructions:
- Follow instructions carefully and to completion; do not leave TODOs.
- If you start a background process, notify the user and make sure to end the process when you are done working.
- Be succinct in your code.
- Keep comments to a minimum. Only include a comment if there is an unusual edge case.
- When adding tests:
  - Check existing tests so you avoid writing duplicates.
  - Test the bare minimum necessary.
  - Factor out commonly reused parts in tests (when there are at least 3 usages).
- Read the first few paragraphs of README.md so you understand the high-level goal of the project.
